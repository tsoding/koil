> [!WARNING]
> We are intentionally rendering on HTML 2D Canvas without employing any hardware acceleration to see how much we can push the boundaries of the software rendering implemented in JavaScript running in Browser. So the renderer may run unexpectedly slow on some machines and browsers, but we are working it.

## Quick Start

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
$ <browser> https://localhost:6969/
```

This script starts up http-server at http://localhost:6969/ to serve the content of the current folder and the server of the game ([server.mts](./server.mts)). See [serve.js](./serve.js) for more details.

## Rebuilding Artifacts

Dependencies

- [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) (Ensure that `wasm2wat` & `wat2wasm` are in PATH)
